<h1>welcome to the blue cube womanâ„¢ website</h1>

<p> hiya I'm Jemma, blue cube woman extrordinare

<br> <br> this little webpage is here to give you a bit of info about me, and linktree to other stuff
<br> <br> - my name's Jemma, I live in california somewhere perhaps. Born on July 3rd, 2006.
<br> <br> - my pronouns are any/she <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@jemmathecube">(my pronouns page)</a>, I don't mind being called other things. gender norms are fucked though
<br> <br> - I'm diagnosed with aspergers (on the autistic spectrum), meaning you're gonna get a lotta rambling sometimes. I kinda need a minute or two to think about stuff as I'm saying it, will flub a lot of what I say when talking. I try my best to express how I feel about subjects, even when they aren't really relevant to much. Thought experiments are a lot of fun and I tend to drone on about those a bit too.
<br> <br> - controversial take I think people are cool. gay people, black people, neurodivergent people, firefighters, people in general I think. Wouldn't exactly call it being progressive or woke or a liberal per se, I think it's basic respect to recognize that people live different lives than you do sometimes, and I try to live with that in mind.
<br> <br> - with that being said I'm gay <br><br>

<div class= "blue1">
<h1><b>Hobbies:</b></h1>
<p> - I like talking and thinking about game development, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/jemmathecube">backloggery page</a> is where I discuss and talk about games I've played, and track my backlog in general.
<br> I wanna work in game development as a career, and I have a lot of particular ideas for games to make.
<br> In general though, besides the game development, I also just play video games a lot in general. 
<br><br> - I mentioned a blurb about how I ramble a lot earlier, but really, I ramble a *lot*. If you strike a fun conversation with me, I'll see it through. Debating philosophy and morality are my absolute jam. I think a lot about a lot of things. Just be sure to not be trolling or something. My discord is <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/538767789674987550/">jemmathecube</a> feel free to hit me up for fun stuff
<br><br> - I also draw in my free time a lot, when I'm feeling bored and wanna watch some youtube idly in the background for a few hours. I like bundling up in bed and drawing on my dinky phone and getting better at it over time. 
<br> I post a lot of my art on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jemmathecube.bsky.social">bluesky</a>, feel free to follow me there for that sorta thing
<br><br> - once in a blue moon I like editing videos here and there, I post on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMPr5Rt2it3H7puDeX9NgrA">youtube channel</a> when I have something to upload. I have a few ongoing projects here and there I want to dedicate time to, but it's nothing too big usually
<br><br> - I've put a lot of time into geometry dash specifically, I know the ins and outs of the editor, I know how the game works top to bottom, and I have <a href="https://gdbrowser.com/u/jemmathecube">a lot to show for it</a>. It's generally contributed to some sorta coding knowledge, but it's the most pathetic kind of coding to have a solid grasp on tbh. I may or may not create stuff on there when I feel like it, but I'm not entirely sure on that as much anymore.
<br><br> - Actively trying to get into music atm, will get back to you on stuff I like

<!--Mission and roadmap-->

<div class= "pink1">
<br> <h2>
<center>What's the point of this site? (Roadmap)</center>
</h2>

<br> <p>This should mainly be for posting gay blogs, showing Geometry Dash stuff I've been working on, publishing mods I've made in one concise place, and organizing art for my oc. Here's a handy dandy roadmap:

<br> <br> <b>v1 requirements:</b>

<!--&#x2714; is for checkmark, &#x2716; is for x-->

<br> <br> <b>Links to social media &#x2714;</b>
<br> Self-explanatory

<br> <br> <b>Geometry Dash Media &#x2714</b> 
<br> Links to created levels in both gdbrowser and youtube, as well as links to a personal spreadsheet and my GDDL account for beaten levels.

<br> <br> <b>Publishing Custom Mods &#x2716;</b>
<br> I've made a fair share of mods over the years, including skin mods for stardew valley, lethal company, hollow knight, and a hat in time, a texture pack for minecraft, extra cards in inscryption, a doom wad that replaces doom guy with my oc, etc. This site would hopefully be a nice place to have downloads and links to all of them, with showcases and instructions on how to set them up. (This is mostly for my sake so I don't have to search for random files on my pc lol, but anyone is free to use these or use them as reference for making your own mods)

<br> <br> <b>Gay blog :3 (in progress, dreams page added)</b>
<br> This would have pictures of the Gay Plush crew I have, as well as other gay stuff, dreams, ramblings, basically a good excuse to have a lot of stuff to write about in a centralized place.

<br> <br> <b>Cool art &#x2714;</b>
<br> This would be a place to store an art portfolio of stuff I've made, as well as organize and share art I've recieved of my oc*
<br> *if you are the artist of art on the page and wish for it to be removed, or want to submit art, dm me on discord @HiyaDerred
<br><br><b>Other fun features:</b>

<br> <br> - The Dark Site/index2 (in progress)
<br> <br> - other easter eggs when I feel like including them
